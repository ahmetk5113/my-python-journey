# *sets topic*
# sets are unordered collections  of unique elements
# meaning there can only be one representative of the same object
# example:
my_set = set()
my_set.add(1)
print(my_set)
# there is an usefull way of using sets:
my_list = [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3]
print(set(my_list))
# it printed out {1,2,3}
# normally sets do not order elements this happened to be like this because i wrote them in  an order
# this might look similar to dictionaries but as far as you can see there is no key-value pairs here
