# dear diary i am so fucked up
# my parents are making fun of me and they are not even letting me to got to my friends birthday party
# im being more and more depressed day by day
# depression is eating me away
# i dont want to leave this world before i actually acomplish something
# thats why i love programming it keeps me moving
# doing something youre passionate about helps you to forget about the negative stuff growing around ourselves
# i am going to exchange my soul with the devil to get the thing i want the most....
# RESPECT ;(
