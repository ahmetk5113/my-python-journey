# **functions**
# creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer
# functions allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times,without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code
# def keyword***
# syntax:
# def name_of_function():
# def ahmet():
#    '''
#    lolllll
#   hi guys bro
#   '''
# this is an example of an multi comment
# which is a multiline comment part
def say_name(name):
    print("hello " + name)

say_name("ahmet")
# briefly explaining return
# here is an example:
def add_numbers(number_1,number_2):
    return number_1 * number_2

result = add_numbers(5,2)
print(result)
# soo idk how to explain this but when we use return we can assign the output of the function to a new variable
